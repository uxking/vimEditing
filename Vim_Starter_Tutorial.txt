First thing is first
***Never use the arrow keys!***
"insert mode" vs "command mode" vs "visual mode"

Get around your file via the 'jkhl' keys
wWbBeE - move to the next: w|W word, b|B backword, e|E end of word
0 - places you at the begining of a line
^ - places you at the begining of the first non whitespace character
$ - places you at the end of the line
1G OR gg - move to top, the first line of the file
12G - is the 12th line of the file
G - last line of the file

Command mode: hit escape
use : (colon) for further actions
File commands
:w  - Saves file
:w <filename> - saves file with <filename>
:q - quit file
:q! - quit without saving
:wq - save and quit the file

Command mode editing commands
x - delete single char
d - delete | dw, diw, d$, dd, <num>dd
dd - delete entire line - everything
dG - delete from current line to the end of the file
s - substitute and places you in insert mode
r - replace - one time function - replaces a single characters with the next characters you type
S - delete entire line and place in insert mode
J - join two lines
. - repeats the last command
* - highlights each occurance of that word
~ - switch case of the current character - also works in visual mode - changes case of highlighted text
u - undo
:redo - redo 

Find and Search
f OR F - finds an occurance of a character on the line your cursor is on
	Example: fa woud find the first "a" on the line you are on
	3fa: would find the 3rd occurance of "a" on the line you are on
Find something and move to it
/ search forward
	Example: /something<enter> moves you to the fisrt occurance of that "something"
	n moves you to the next occurance - N moves you to the previous occurance
? search backward 
	Example: ?something<enter> moves you backward to the occurance of that "something"
	n moves you back further to the next item - N moves you to the next occurance

Insert mode:
Various ways to get into insert mode.
i - gets into insert mode at the cursor - start typing
a - gets into insert mode following the cursor
c - change | cw - change word | ciw - change in word | ci', ci", ci(, ci{ - change in ', " , (), {}
o - new line after cursor
O - new line before cursor

Cut and Pasting
In command mode
y - yank text | yy - yank line | Y - same as yy| <num>yy OR 3Y - yanks 3 lines| yiw | yw | <num>yw | y$ - yank to end of line 
	In visual mode Y is lines and y is text or chars (it's wierd, but they are pretty much interchangable)
p - paste after | P - paste before
	Example: 3Yp yanks three lines and pastes them after the current line
	xp - deletes one character and pastes it after the delete. Good for swapping characters 
	("mkie" would become "mike" if I did xp with the cursor at the "k")

Read output from a file or a command into your file
:read Myfile.txt - reads the contents of Myfile.txt into the current vim session
:read !ls - adds the output of the ls command to your current vim session

Visual Mode
In command mode type v
This allows you to highlight text and issue commands against the highlighted text- like d, c, y, s, x

Cool things you can do in command mode
:set number - adds numbers to your vim
:set relativenumber - adds relative numbers to vim
:set hlsearch - highlights searchessearches
:set incsearch - highlights searches as you type them 
:noh - clears the highlight until next search
:syntax on - syntax highlighting for certain files
:! run a shell command - does not put the ouput in the vim session
:f - gives you information about the current file you are editing
